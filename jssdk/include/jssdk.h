 * - enter/leave js engine's thread unlocker
 * - enter js scope/handlescope after app switch to js thread
 * - leave js scope/handlescope before app switch away from js thread
 * 
 * for js engine working alone as/in one thread but could be called on multiple-threads environtment, there are `Locker/Unlocker` in general to
 * help program determine which thread COULD get ownership of js engine.
 * 
 * - Locker: declare current thread want to use js engine, if js engine owned by another thread, current thread would wait.
 * - Unlocker: declare current thread would release ownership of js engine.
 * 
 * for Locker/Unlocer, two types operations are used to help program assign js engine to specific thread safely
 * - Locker::enter(): try to hold js engine from current thread
 * - Locker::leave(): do sth when current thread has get ownership of js engine
 * - Unlocker::enter(): try to release js engine from current thread
 * - Unlocker::leave(): do sth when current thread has given back ownership of js engine
